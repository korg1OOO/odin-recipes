    <h2 class="steps">Description</h2>
    <p>This lemonade recipe is for real, authentic, vintage lemonade—the kind you might enjoy on a hot summer day at one of those stands at the state fair.</p>
    <p>Most of us make lemonade just out of lemon juice, but as you may know, the oils in the lemon peel contain a tremendous amount of flavor, and once you drink this, you won't want to go back to drinking it how you used to.</p>
    <h2 class="steps">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Lemons</li>
        <li>White Sugar</li>
        <li>Cold Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list ol">
        <li>Wash lemons and peel off all the zest using a vegetable peeler; set peeled lemons aside. Add lemon zest to a bowl and cover with sugar; toss to combine. Cover and let sit for a minimum of 2 hours, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a pot over high heat; turn off heat and pour in lemon-sugar mixture. Stir and let sit until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour through a mesh strainer back into the same bowl and discard the zest. Let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut lemons in half and squeeze juice into the bowl. Pour lemonade into a serving pitcher; cover and chill thoroughly before serving over ice, at least 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
